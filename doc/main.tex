\section{Introduction}
\section{Methods}
\subsection{Decoding of PD-relevant motor performance}

Based on the assumption that relevant NM can be found in cortical and subcortical signals, it can be hypothesized that underlying EEG sources may contain relevant information about NMs for PD.  Following, we will describe how these informative oscillatory sources can be recovered from overlapping confounds and noisy EEG signals in a short-timescale, single-trial basis. 

\subsubsection{Forward model of EEG generation}
\label{par:modeling}
%\begin{figure}[h!]
Due to volume conduction, non-invasive imaging techniques, as EEG, measure electrical brain activity generated by superimposed hidden brain sources. In general, the properties of such superposition is linear, thus, it can be described as a linear combination of neural generators, which can be modeled as follows.

Let $\mat{X}\negmedspace\in\negmedspace \Real^{N_c \times N_t}$ be a multivariate variable to describe data of brain activity measured in the EEG sensor space, where $N_t$ is the number of time samples and $N_c$ the number of sensors. Furthermore, let $\mat{S} \negmedspace\in\negmedspace \Real^{N_s \times N_t}$ describe the time course of $N_s$ neural sources, where $N_s$ describes the number of hidden neural sources considered. Then, the general EEG generative model can be written as: 
\begin{align}\label{eq:genModel}
\mat{X}=\mat{A}\,\mat{S} + \mat{E} \;.
\end{align} 
In this model, matrix $\mat{A}\negmedspace\in\negmedspace \Real^{N_c \times N_s}$ describes the projection of the sources to the sensor space, where the columns of $\mat{A}$, $\ve{a} \negmedspace\in\negmedspace \Real^{N_c}$, are referred to as \emph{spatial patterns}. Furthermore, the matrix $\mat{E}$ contains spatially and temporally uncorrelated noise to model measurement noise. 

An estimation of the time-course of a source component, i.e.\ $\hat{\ve{s}}$, can be extracted from the measurements by way of a \emph{spatial filter} $\ve{w} \in \Real^{N_c}$, which projects the data from sensor space into source space. Thus we have $\hat{\ve{s}} = \ve{w}^\top\mat{X}$.
%A source component $\hat{\ve{s}}_X=\ve{w}^\top\mat{X}$
%can be extracted from the time course of the sensor data by applying a  spatial filter $\mat{w}\negmedspace\in\negmedspace\Real^{N_c \times 1}$, which projects data from the sensor space to the source space. 
For many problems, such a spatial filter $\mat{w}$ is not known a priori and must be estimated from the data. However, once a spatial filter (or an entire set thereof, denoted by $\mat{W} \in \Real^{N_c \times N_s}$, where each column $\ve{w}$ represents a single spatial filter) has been obtained, an estimate of the corresponding spatial patterns can be computed via the relation $ \hat{\mat{A}} = \mat{C} \mat{W} \left( \mat{W}^\top \mat{C} \mat{W} \right)^{-1} $, where $\mat{C} \in  \Real^{N_c \times N_c} $ denotes the spatial covariance matrix of the data $\mat{X}$. See \cite{haufe2014interpretation} for further details on the relation between spatial filters and spatial patterns.  


\subsubsection{Source Power Co-modulation --- SPoC}
\label{par:spoc}
The source power co-modulation (SPoC) method introduced in~\cite{dahne2014spoc} utilizes a supervised regression approach in order to estimate a set of spatial filters $\mat{W}$. The method assumes that the recorded data $\mat{X}$ has been pre-filtered to a narrow frequency band, which contains the oscillatory source of interest. 

Based on data of multiple epochs $e$, a filter $\mat{w}$ is optimized such that the power of an epoch $\Theta_x(e) = \operatorname{var}[\hat{\ve{s}}](e)$ of the spatially filtered data $\hat{\ve{s}}=\mat{w}^\top\mat{X}$, maximally covaries with a known, epoch-wise defined univariate target variable $z(e)$. For the sake of simplicity in the notation, $\hat{\ve{s}}$ will be noted as $\ve{s}$, hereafter.
 
%\end{align}
It can be shown that solving the optimization problem described above, is equivalent to solving the following generalized eigenvalue problem
\begin{align}\label{eq:eig_spoc}
\mat{C}_z\mat{W} = \mat{\Lambda}\mat{C}\mat{W}
\end{align}
where $\mat{C}_z = \left<\mat{C}(e)z(e)\right>$, $\mat{C} = \left<\mat{C}(e)\right>$, and $\left<\mat{C}(e)\right>$ and $\left<\mat{C}(e)z(e)\right>$ are, respectively, the weighted covariance and covariance of $\mat{X}$, averaged across epochs $e$: $\mat{C}(e) = \mat{X}(e)\mat{X}(e)^\T$; and $\mat{\Lambda} \in \Real^{N_c\times N_c}$ is a matrix containing the corresponding eigenvalues in the main diagonal.

Given a spatial filter $\mat{w}_{tr}$ determined on training data $tr$, the true target variable $z$ can subsequently be approximated on a single-trial basis for unseen test data ($te$) epochs $\mat{X}_{te}$ via $\hat{z}(e) = \operatorname{var}[\mat{w}_{tr}^\top\mat{X}_{te}(e)]$. 

\subsubsection{Motor paradigm - The \textit{copy-draw} task}
For assessing PD-relevant fine-motor performance on short-timescales, we propose the use of a complex hand-drawing task, termed the \textit{copy-draw task}. The copy-draw task was originally introduced by \cite{prichard2014effects}, as a motor skill learning assessment tool requiring \textit{complex, synergistic and continuous movements of multiple hand and arm muscles}, therefore, suitable for assessing upper-limb fine-motor performance affected by PD symptoms as bradykinesia, rigor, and tremor.

During the copy-draw task, patients sit comfortably approximately 60\,cm in front of a 22'' screen and a digital drawing pad. At the beginning of a \textit{trial}, a trace composed of pseudo-letters (\textit{atoms}) is displayed on screen inside a \textit{drawing box}. For starting the trial, patients are required to tap a cyan \textit{get-ready} box located on the top-left corner outside of the drawing box and then proceed to the beginning of the trace, marked by a red circle. When the begining of the traced is reached, a timer starts a countdown indicating how much time the patient has left to complete the trace displayed. In the present study, six different traces were generated by permuting the elements of a three-atom dictionary, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:paradigm_layout}

During the entire experiment, patients are instructed (via a text on the screen) to be as precise as possible while trying to complete the whole trace. No further instructions were provided, besides advising not to change the precision-speed trade-off throughout the session.

\paragraph{PD-relevant fine-motor performance:} To evaluate the single-trial performance achieved in the copy draw task, we compute the \textit{path length} (PL) with  $ \left\lbrace PL \in \Real | 0 \leq PL \leq 1 \right\rbrace$. The PL is a normalized metric describing. what portion of each trace was completed, being 1 the complete trace and 0 a totally un-drawn path.

\section{Experimental setup}

\subsection{Study design}
Three PD patients (P1, P2, and P3) were bilaterally implanted in the STN with directional DBS electrodes (Vercise Cartesia \texttrademark Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA). After implantation, DBS leads were kept externalized during three days following surgery (D1, D2, and D3). On day four, leads were internalized and pulse generator (IPG) was implanted. Each patient participated in 5 experimental sessions, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:sessions_overview}. In four of the five sessions, the copy-draw task was executed under different conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Pre-session}: An EEG-only session, several days prior to implantation surgery.
\item \textit{Acute sessions D2 and D3}: On days two and three after DBS electrode implantation, the copy-draw task was executed under varying stimulation regimes with concurrent EEG and LFP recordings.
\item \textit{Chronic session}: During the first control-visit after DBS system implantation (at least one month thereupon), patients participated in a final EEG session, where the copy-draw task was executed under varying DBS and medication conditions.
\end{itemize}

Each copy-draw session was structured in the form of \text{blocks}, where each block comprised 12 trials. For each session, a number of at least 8 \textit{blocks} were executed, in order to guarantee enough data samples to reliably train the SPoC model. Sessions D2 and D3 of patient P3 were left out of further analysis, due to their premature interruption, at 5 and 6 blocks, respectively.

Furthermore, dopaminergic medication was suspended at least 12 hours before each session. During the sessions, patients were allowed to take the suspended medication (Madopar LT, T, or Stalevo) according to the level of discomfort occasioned by PD symptoms.

\subsection{Signal acquisition}
\subsubsection{EEG-only sessions -- Pre-/ and chronic sessions}
EEG signals were recorded from 64 passive Ag/AgCl electrodes (EasyCap GmbH, Germany) placed according to the extended 10-20 system. Impedances were kept below 20\,k$\Omega$. All channels were referenced against the nose during recording. The EEG signals were registered by BrainAmp DC amplifiers (Brain Products GmbH, Germany) at a sampling rate of 1\,kHz, with an analog lowpass filter of 250\,Hz applied before digitization.

\subsubsection{Acute sessions with externalized DBS electrodes}
EEG signals were recorded from a variable number of the same passive Ag/AgCl electrodes placed according to the 10-10 system, using an EEG cap with 128 electrodes. The EEG electrodes chosen for recording were carefully selected, so as to avoid injured tissue. Areas avoided corresponded to fronto-central, central, and centro-parietal electrodes, slightly asymmetrical, depending on the side from which the leads were externalized, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:paradigm_layout}. Impedance of the selected electrodes were kept below 20\,k$\Omega$.

DBS electrodes were connected the NeuoOmega system (AlphaOmega, Israel), were DBS was delivered according to each condition

\section{Results}
\subsection{Modulation of motor-performance}
Figure \ref{fig:behavioral_all} shows the $PL$ score achieved by the patients in all the sessions. Complex medication-stimulation interaction can be seen for many of the recordings. For example, in session P1-D2, DBS does not have an evident effect in motor performance at the beginning of the session, but after intake of dopaminergic medication, a clear difference between DBS ON and OFF may be observed
